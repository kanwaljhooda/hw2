Our faith community has an institution devoted to improving the Quality of life for our community members.
This institution, called Quality of Life (QOL), has an initiative to help members build skills in various fields to improve their earning potential and in turn their quality of life.
As part of this initiative, I will be leading an Intermediate Excel Course for 5-weeks during Spring quarter.
This website was created with the goal of serving the marketing and registration process in mind.
It will not likely be used given the timeline of the course and my current website making skills.
